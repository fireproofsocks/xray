Xray is an academic exploration of strings and encodings in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

It offers utility functions useful for inspecting strings and their code points to better understand strings and encodings.

## Examples

The `Xray.inspect/1` function gives you a deep introspection on a string:

```elixir
iex> Xray.inspect("cÃ¤t")
    ======================================================
    Input String: cÃ¤t
    Character Count: 3
    Byte Count: 4
    Is valid? true
    Is printable? true
    ======================================================

    c   Codepoint: 99 (\u0063) https://codepoints.net/U+0063
      Is printable? true
      Script(s): latin
      Byte Count: 1
      UTF-8: <<99>>
      Base2: 01100011

    Ã¤   Codepoint: 228 (\u00E4) https://codepoints.net/U+00E4
      Is printable? true
      Script(s): latin
      Byte Count: 2
      UTF-8: <<195, 164>>
      Base2: 11000011 10100100

    t   Codepoint: 116 (\u0074) https://codepoints.net/U+0074
      Is printable? true
      Script(s): latin
      Byte Count: 1
      UTF-8: <<116>>
      Base2: 01110100
    [:ok, :ok, :ok]
```

The `Xray.codepoint/2` function provides the code point for a single character -- functionally, this is equivalent to what the question-mark operator `?` does, but `Xray.codepoint/2` allows you to inspect a variable (whereas `?` only operates on literal values):

```elixir
iex> Xray.codepoint("Ã¤")
228
```

`Xray.codepoints/2` allows you to inspect the component codepoint numbers that make up the given string:

```elixir
iex> Xray.codepoints("cÃ¤t")
      "99, 228, 116"
```

See [Xray Hex Docs](https://hexdocs.pm/xray/Xray.html) for more info.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `xray` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:xray, "~> 1.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/xray](https://hexdocs.pm/xray).

## On Codepoints vs Graphemes

```elixir
iex> String.codepoints("ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸")
["ðŸ‡º", "ðŸ‡¸"]
iex> String.split("ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸", "", trim: true)
["ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"]
iex> "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸" <><<0>>
<<240, 159, 135, 186, 240, 159, 135, 184, 0>>
```
